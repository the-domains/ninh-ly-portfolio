Pentair Aquatic Systems produces pool products for consumers. Pentair Product Registration and Rebates allows consumers to register their Pentair products for warranty and/or rebates. 

### Goals

1. Register products for warranty and/or rebates 
2. Get status updates on submitted registrations 

### Approach

We reviewed all the feedback from customers and interviewed stakeholders to gain insight. This screen is the old product registration process. As you can see, everything was on one page and wasn't very user friendly. 

#### Data

I worked with the business analyst to gather data from 2015\.

#### Competitive Research

As a team, we conducted competitive research. We studied a competitor of Pentair to analyze their Product Registration process. 

### Final Designs

Here are some of the final screens. I worked on the visual design and front end development. I worked closely with the developer and business analyst and revised some design interactions as requirements changed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/010d2d8c-1324-41c3-8fda-42cb03d354d5.jpg)
